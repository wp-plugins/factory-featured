== Description ==
Factory Featured Plugin displays a set amount of posts in a loop with a custom field image and links to that post, making a gallery of images linked to the posts.

Has configurable settings, such as;
* Image Width and Height
* Set the category to pull posts from
* Set the amount of posts to show.

Nice and easy way to present a certain category of posts in a widget area. Have a look at the Sceenshots to get a better idea of what it looks like.
